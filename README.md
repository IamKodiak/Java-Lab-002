# Java-Lab-002

## Variables, Types and Operators

Be able to explain what variables are. Understand variable types, allowed names, and valid values.
Know how to create and use string, integer, floating-point, and boolean variables.

### Part 1 - PricelessScript.java - [MasterCard YouTube Ad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_6stXKGuHo)

The lab template contains a program that prints the following:
```
2 tickets: $28.00
2 hotdogs, 2 popcorn, 2 sodas: $18.00
1 autographed baseball $45.00
real conversation with 11 year old son: priceless
true
```

Ignore the code that you don't fully recognize and concentrate on changing the variables to alter the MasterCard *Priceless* script to say:
```
3 tickets: $42.00
3 hotdogs, 3 popcorn, 3 sodas: $27.00
2 autographed baseball $90.00
watching the Giants win: priceless
false
```

### Part 2 - Interpretation
Take note of the various variables and their data types. Write a brief summary in this section of the README.md file listing the:
* Variable name
* Its data type
* and example values you can assign them.



       One example of a variable used in this lab is the "boolean" variable. It is used to determine whether something is true or false. Values you could assign it are "true" or "false".
    
Next give TWO example variable names and TWO example variable assignments that are *WRONG* and explain why.

    The "int" variable is used for integers, so assigning a decimal or fraction to it would result in an error.
    The "float" variable is used for not-so-complicated decimals or fractions, so assigning it an infinite decimal, such as PI, would result in an error.
* Hint: your IDE can help you discover these!

### Part 3 - Bonus: Play around with Java String Format Specifiers.

Pick several of the Java format specifiers below and define variables of the correct type utilize *sout* and *String.format* to view the resulting formats.

### Part 4 - Submission
* Commit your working code
* Push it to your Remote/origin branch (i.e. GitHub)
* Then issue a Pull request to the instructor branch
    * Make sure to save the Pull request URL and submit it for the lab.
